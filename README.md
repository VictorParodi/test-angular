# Your First Unit Test in Angular

In this workshop we'll cover the most common unit tests in Angular Applications. We'll learn some basics by doing testing to Components, Services and Pipes. Hope you enjoy :blush:

During whole workshop we will work on  `Chuck Norris Jokes` application, which is a very basic app about consuming a random Chuck Norris Jokes API and the result is displayed on the screen.

## 1. Download or clone this Repo

After downloading or cloning the app, you have to install all its dependencies running `npm install`, this process can take a couple of minutes, so.. go for some coffee and wait :coffee:

## 2. Run Application

Once all depencecies have been installed, it's time to run our application. Simply run `ng serve -o` and after a few seconds, the app will be served at `localhost:4200`.
